Do you want to automate things that you repeatedly do on a linux command line?. ‘Autoexpect’ would do that for you!. 

It is nothing but an except script that is generated automatically for you.

In a simple words….
1.	Enable auto expect (comes along with all Linux packages).
2.	For one time,  type all your commands manually that you want to automate.
3.	Disable autoexpect and you are done!!. The autoexpect would automatically generate a script file.

Try it:

$ Autoexpect
Autoexpect started, file is script.exp
$ <start typing your commands>

press Ctrl+D on your keyboard to stop Autoexpect


For further information refer to http://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/Automating-with-Expect-Scripts 
Note: A small tuning/cleanup is required on a generated file, because for example if you had typed ‘ls’ even that gets recorded/automated in the script. 

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach me.
